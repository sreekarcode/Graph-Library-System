# Graph-Library-System

## PROJECT 1 - Graph Library Project(GP)

Interface
- C++
- PyBind
- In ubuntu

Files
- Main File
- PyBind file with Python code .. testcases
- Library files

To implement all these graph algorithms-
- Support for directed and undirected graphs
- Support for node and edge creation
- Detection of cycles
- Implement the following graph algorithms:
- Node colouring
- Edge colouring
- Detect and complete edges
- Connected components
- Graph centrality (Katz's)
- Prim's algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Iterative Depth First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search
